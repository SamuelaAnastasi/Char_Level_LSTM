# Char_Level_LSTM
This project is part of Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree - Lesson 4 LSTM. The model implements a character-level LSTM with PyTorch. The network will train character by character on some text, then generate new text character by character. This model will be able to generate new text based on the text from the Anna Karenina book.
